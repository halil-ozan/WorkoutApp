## MERN Stack Project

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The app was created as part of the Net Ninja MERN stack tutorial series.

## Project Features

- User Authentication: User login and registration using JWT tokens.

- CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing items (e.g., posts, products, or any data).

- Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and works well on all devices.

- Real-time Updates: Using sockets (or any other methods), the app supports real-time data updates.

- Error Handling: Proper error handling for both server-side and client-side issues.

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data and other application data.

- Express.js: Web framework for Node.js for handling API requests.

- React.js: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the back-end API.

- JWT: JSON Web Token for secure authentication.
